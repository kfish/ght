Git wrangling
=============

Log
---

Follow all parents of merges in log (zipper?)

Pack files
----------

  * verify version numbers of pack is known

  * verify offsets for idx are within mmap'ped size

  * track file offsets of pack objects

  * verify idx offsets vs. pack parse

  * implement abstract object lookup via idx & pack reader, lazily
with error fallback on corrupt idx

Goal: robust ght show

Root
----

* Handle a working tree where .git is a plain ASCII file containing
"gitdir: <path>", i.e. the path to the real git repository.

Config
------
parse .git/config
find ~/.gitconfig

SHA1
----

expand sha1 prefix into full matching sha1
verify blob sha1sums

Revision names
--------------

Handle A^
Handle A^^
Handle A~n
Handle A^^n
Handle A^n^m


Commands
========

* find redundant upstream branches, ie. stuff that has been merged and can
be safely deleted.


Haskell cruft
=============

Use a left-fold enumerator for following branch histories
Traverse with a zipper, as IO traversable history
